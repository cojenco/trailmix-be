# Trail Mix Live
### A web application to share live status updates on trails.

Have you ever planned for the best weekend hike, and yet ended up arriving at the trailhead with no parking spots available? Or amid the COVID-19 pandemic, arrive at a recreation spot with too many people to practice social distancing and #RecreateResponsibly. Trail Mix Live provides an information hub where the community can share live updates on the parking status, visitors traffic, and locale weather.

Trail Mix Live was developed as a capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/), a nonprofit full-stack web development program for women and gender diverse individuals in Seattle, Washington.
##### Please note that this is the back-end respository.

## App Features
-  User can search for trails in different states and search for trails nearby after enabling geolocation. 
-  User can get and post the lastest status updates on parking, visitors traffic, and weather of that trail.
-  User can subscribe to trails and receive SMS notifications in the next 24 hours if there are new status updates shared on this site.
